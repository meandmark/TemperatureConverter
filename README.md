# TemperatureConverter

I am writing a tutorial for a simple Cocoa application that uses storyboards. TemperatureConverter is the project for the application I create in the tutorial. Enter a Celsuius temperature in the text field. Click the Convert button to see the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
